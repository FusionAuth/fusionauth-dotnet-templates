# FusionAuth .NET Blazor Server Template Project

## Setup

This project includes a setup script to prepare FusionAuth.

Note that the setup script is designed to run on a newly installed FusionAuth instance with only one user and no tenants other than `Default`. To use the setup script on a FusionAuth instance that does not meet these criteria, you may need to modify the scripts.

### Creating an API key

Before running the script, you will need to create an API key. 

Log into your FusionAuth instance. If it's you're first time logging in, you'll need to set up a user and a password, as well as accept the terms and conditions.

Navigate to Settings -> API Keys. Click the + button to add a new API Key. Copy the value of the Key field and then save the key. It might be a value like CY1EUq2oAQrCgE7azl3A2xwG-OEwGPqLryDRBCoz-13IqyFYMn1_Udjt.
